# 🌐 Cloud Performance Dashboard

A **Next.js** web application that visualizes exchange server and cloud server performance data through interactive **charts** and **3D visualizations**.  
This project integrates **Chart.js**, **Three.js**, and **CloudPing** to present latency, performance, and network data in an engaging way.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Interactive charts powered by **Chart.js**  
- 🌍 3D visualization of servers and network topology using **Three.js**  
- ⚡ Cloud latency testing integrated with **CloudPing**  
- 💡 Built on **Next.js** for fast rendering and smooth navigation  
- Segragation of components for simplification.

## 🧩 Technologies & Libraries Used

| Library / Tool | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Next.js** | React-based framework for web app development |
| **Chart.js** | Data visualization library for charts and graphs |
| **Three.js** | 3D rendering and animations |
| **CloudPing** | Latency measurement for cloud regions |
| **React** | UI components and state management |
| **CSS / Tailwind / SCSS** | Styling and layout (depending on project setup) |

## 🧠 Assumptions Made

- The **exchange server** and **cloud server data** are **simulated or assumed** for demonstration purposes.  
- No live connection to real-world exchange or cloud APIs — data is either mocked or stored locally.  
- The **CloudPing** integration may use public API endpoints or simulated results to demonstrate latency visualization.  
- All charts and 3D models are meant to **represent** trends rather than display real-time production data.
